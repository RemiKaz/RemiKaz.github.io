Here is a summary of all the projects I was involved on, with some comments and resulting contributions. All the sections refers to phases refering to a subject I was involved on, And subsections refers to specific projects I conducted during this phase. If you just want a formal list of my experiences, the best choice is to look at [my Google Scholar profile]({{site.data.author.googlescholar}}) or my [CV](https://remikaz.github.io/files/CV_Rémi_Kazmierczak_English.pdf).

## 2020: Tracking 

I started to do reserarch in my M1 internship in 2020 at the SATIE laboratory at ENS Paris-Saclay during COVID-19 pandemic. I was working in finding the best algorithm to participate to the MOT20 Pedestrian Detection Challenge, a multi-object tracking challenge on highly densely crowded scenes. I have not so much to say about this phase, honestly I was not very entousiastic working about a task that can have easily malignant applications. But honestly, considering my expertise at this time, there was very little chance that a revolutionary contribution could be made anyways. But honeslty it was a very good subject to learn the ropes. If this project did not induced a publication, the proposed method was ranked 2nd, so it was kind of a success.

## 2021-2022: Image Generation 

Then, I continued to do reserch after my M2. At this time, there was a strong hype in GANs, that was the state of the art to generate images before diffusion models. Then, I worked on developing new methods in two applications, industrial inspection and autonomous driving.

### 2021: Image synthesis for anomaly detection

I started with an internship in SAFRAN-tech, where my goal was to build a synthetic dataset of images of aircraft parts to train an anomaly detection model. I had the chance to be able to explore a lot during this internship, so beside applying the current sota methods on the internal datasets, I also proposed some methods to
