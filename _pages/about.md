My name is Rémi Kazmierczak, I am a researcher in the field of **Interpretability** in **Deep Learning**, recently graduated from the **Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IP Paris)** with a PhD conducted in the **U2IS** laboratory of **ENSTA Paris**. I am also a graduate from **ENS Paris-Saclay**. Currently, I am performing some research indeprendently, but I also looking for a post-doctoral position in France, preferably near Paris / Saclay.

My research interests are centered arround understanding the functioning of deep neural networks, especially foundation models. I founded facinating we have been able to produce such models, but we still do not understand how they work.
