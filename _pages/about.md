My name is Rémi Kazmierczak, and I am a researcher in the field of Interpretability in Deep Learning. I recently graduated from the Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IP Paris) with a PhD conducted in the U2IS laboratory at ENSTA Paris. I am also a graduate of ENS Paris-Saclay. Currently, I am conducting independent research while looking for a post-doctoral position in France, preferably near Paris or Saclay.

My research interests focus on understanding how deep neural networks function, particularly foundation models. I find it fascinating that we have been able to develop such powerful models, yet we still do not fully understand how they work.

On another note, I love teaching. If you need someone to handle teaching responsibilities, I’d be happy to help!

For now, this website is intended to gather all my information in one place. Just keep in mind that I might forget to update it regularly :eyes:.
